# **V1.04.1 Patch Notes**  

## **New Commands/Features:**

Added `%commands` as an alias for `%help`.  

Created a command `%sendidol [idol id] [#text channel]` to automatically post a photo of an   
idol after every 12 hours in a channel.  
-> Patrons get 3x more idols in a text channel than non-patrons do.  
-> not specifying an idol id will remove all idols in the channel.  
-> To remove an idol, you may repeat the command you used to add them.  

## **Bug/Issue/Backend Fixes/Changes:**

Added Active Unscramble games as a metric.
